### Project Name: Spots

**Intro**

#This is social media web application where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make changes to their own profile.

It has been built using html and css. I used both flexbox and grid because the site becomes responsive for most the section. So I have to work less during writing code for breakpoints.
