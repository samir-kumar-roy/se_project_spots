### Project Name: Spots

**Intro**

This is social media web application where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make changes to their own profile.

# It has been built using html and css. I used both flexbox and grid because the site becomes responsive for most mf the section. So I ahve to work less during writing code for breakpoints
